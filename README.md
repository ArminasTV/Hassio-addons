RaspAP is feature-rich wireless router software that _just works_ on many popular [Debian-based devices](#supported-operating-systems), including the Raspberry Pi. Our popular [Quick installer](#quick-installer) creates a known-good default configuration for all current Raspberry Pis with onboard wireless. A fully responsive, mobile-ready interface gives you control over the relevant services and networking options. Advanced DHCP settings, WireGuard and OpenVPN support, [SSL certificates](https://docs.raspap.com/ssl-quick/), security audits, [captive portal integration](https://docs.raspap.com/captive/), themes and [multilingual options](https://docs.raspap.com/translations/) are included.
